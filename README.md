This repository includes my own solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, written in TypeScript and Python3.

## Language of Choice

Halfway through this problem collection, I switched from Python to TypeScript. At that time, I had been intensively using Python on LeetCode for almost a year, but I had never stopped wondering which language was the best choice for me in online assessments or technical interviews.

Python had been my language of choice for a long time when practicing DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms). When I first started on LeetCode, I experimented with several languages but eventually settled on Python for its suitability for rapid prototyping (same logic with less code) and its convenient standard libraries, such as `heapq` for priority queues.

However, issues manifested themselves as I progressed in my career. As a developer who spends most of his time writing TypeScript (and JavaScript), I noticed a growing inconsistency between my day-to-day work and my DSA practice. While DSA concepts are largely language-agnostic, I often found myself tripping over syntax due to the mental "context switching" involved. For example, when writing a loop, I would hesitate over whether to use `for...of` (JavaScript) or `for...in` (Python) - and sometimes I wouldn’t even realize I had used the wrong syntax until error were reported at runtime.

These moments eventually led me to commit to a single programming language for practice, rather than trying to maintain proficiency across multiple languages. For those with prior experience in Java or C++ - two of the [most popular programming languages](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/vgg9xr/what_are_the_programming_languages_that_your/) taught in schools - TypeScript may also feel like a more natural choice than Python, especially given its its syntax and support for types.
